why is this not rendering as dark theme 

oh it did, guess the theme can not be unrefreshed for one post while it refreshed for another

also restoring text below, seemed like the number list rendered better with dark theme?

# testing headings
## and subheadings
### and soforth
_italics_
`(formatting == code) == True`

regular text as well

    1. numbered
    2. list
    3. did not work
