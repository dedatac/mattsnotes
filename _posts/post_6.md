# post idea

    1. I want to make a quick observation about the Rep. McBride interview. Problems can be difficult and talk is generally cheap but we can ask: "does this succeed on its own terms?"

    2. detour: accessibility is important. ALT text, captions, etc. Human-edited transcripts are part of this social infrastructure. Let's compare the apple podcasts transcript with a model we run ourselves, then compare that to what we heard. (for feasibility: compare diffs of full output, but HE only two excerpts)

    3. Present 2 captioned clips with HE transcripst of the excerpts. Compare: 1. response to Gaza question 2. four freedoms segment
